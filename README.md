## Installation

To set up a virtual environment and install PyTorch, follow these steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```
   Make sure to use python version > 3.11.

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install PyTorch**:
   ```bash
   pip install torch
   ```


This will create a virtual environment named `myenv`, activate it, and install PyTorch along with its dependencies. You can verify the installation by running the provided Python code to check the PyTorch version.
